Hello Claude,

I need your help in creating a Python-based MCP (Mission Control Program) to interact with the Israeli government's public real estate data API (Govmap). The primary goal of this MCP is to allow a real estate agent to query for recent property deals based on a given address.

Please generate a complete Python project structure (or merge with the current project), including a README.md file, a requirements.txt file, and the main Python script. The project should be well-documented, easy to set up, and provide clear functions for accessing the different API endpoints.

Here is a breakdown of the requirements:

Project Structure
Please create the following file structure:

nadlan-mcp/
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
└── nadlan_mcp/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── main.py

README.md File
The README.md file should be comprehensive and include the following sections:

Project Title: Israel Real Estate MCP

Description: A short description of the project's purpose.

Features: A list of the key functionalities, such as searching for properties, finding block/parcel information, and retrieving deal data.

Installation: Clear instructions on how to set up the project, including cloning the repository, creating a virtual environment, and installing the required packages using requirements.txt.

Usage: Detailed examples of how to use the Python functions from the main.py script. This should include code snippets for each of the main use cases.

API Reference: A brief overview of the Govmap API endpoints being used.

requirements.txt File
This file should list all the necessary Python libraries for the project. At a minimum, it should include:

requests
python-dotenv

Python Code (nadlan_mcp/main.py)
This will be the core of the project. Please implement the following functions, making sure to handle potential errors (e.g., network issues, invalid API responses) gracefully.

API Client Setup
Create a class GovmapClient that will handle all interactions with the Govmap API.

The base URL for the API is https://www.govmap.gov.il/api/.

The class should use a requests.Session object to manage connections.

Functions to Implement
autocomplete_address(search_text: str)

Purpose: Given a free-text address, this function should use the /search-service/autocomplete endpoint to find the most likely match.

Parameters:

search_text: The address to search for (e.g., "סוקולוב 38 חולון").

Returns: The JSON response from the API, which includes the coordinates of the address.

get_gush_helka(point: tuple)

Purpose: Given a coordinate point, this function should use the /layers-catalog/entitiesByPoint endpoint to retrieve the "Gush" (Block) and "Helka" (Parcel) information.

Parameters:

point: A tuple of (longitude, latitude).

Returns: The JSON response containing the block and parcel data.

get_deals_by_radius(point: tuple, radius: int = 50)

Purpose: Finds high-level information about real estate deals within a specified radius of a point. Uses the /real-estate/deals/{point}/{radius} endpoint.

Parameters:

point: A tuple of (longitude, latitude).

radius: The search radius in meters (default to 50).

Returns: A list of deals found within the radius.

get_street_deals(polygon_id: str, limit: int = 10, start_date: str = None, end_date: str = None)

Purpose: Retrieves detailed information about deals on a specific street, identified by a polygon_id. Uses the /real-estate/street-deals/{polygon_id} endpoint.

Parameters:

polygon_id: The ID of the lot's polygon.

limit: The maximum number of deals to return (default to 10).

start_date: The start date for the search in 'YYYY-MM' format.

end_date: The end date for the search in 'YYYY-MM' format.

Returns: A list of detailed deal information for the street.

get_neighborhood_deals(polygon_id: str, limit: int = 10, start_date: str = None, end_date: str = None)

Purpose: Retrieves deals within the same neighborhood as the given polygon_id. Uses the /real-estate/neighborhood-deals/{polygon_id} endpoint.

Parameters:

polygon_id: The ID of the lot's polygon.

limit: The maximum number of deals to return (default to 10).

start_date: The start date for the search in 'YYYY-MM' format.

end_date: The end date for the search in 'YYYY-MM' format.

Returns: A list of deals in the neighborhood.

Main Use Case Function
Please create a high-level function that ties everything together for the primary use case.

find_recent_deals_for_address(address: str, years_back: int = 2)

Purpose: This function should take an address and find all relevant real estate deals from the last few years.

Workflow:

Call autocomplete_address to get the coordinates for the given address.

Extract the point from the autocomplete response.

Call get_deals_by_radius to get the polygon_id for nearby properties.

For each unique polygon_id found, call get_street_deals and get_neighborhood_deals.

Filter the results to only include deals within the specified time frame (years_back).

Combine and de-duplicate the results.

Return a clean, formatted list of deals.

API Query Examples for Context
Here are some curl examples that show how the API works. Please use these as a reference when building the Python functions.

Autocomplete:

curl -X POST https://www.govmap.gov.il/api/search-service/autocomplete -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"searchText": "סוקולוב 38 חולון", "language": "he", "isAccurate": false, "maxResults": 10}'

Entities by Point (Gush/Helka):

curl -X POST https://www.govmap.gov.il/api/layers-catalog/entitiesByPoint -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"point":[3870923.9531396534,3766288.069885358],"layers":[{"layerId":"16"}],"tolerance":0}'

Deals by Radius:

curl -X GET https://www.govmap.gov.il/api/real-estate/deals/3872355.023513328,3765591.163209798/30

Street Deals:

curl -X GET "https://www.govmap.gov.il/api/real-estate/street-deals/52190246?limit=3"

Neighborhood Deals:

curl -X GET "https://www.govmap.gov.il/api/real-estate/neighborhood-deals/52282030?limit=8"

Please ensure the final output is a complete, runnable, and well-documented Python project that fulfills all these requirements. Thank you!
